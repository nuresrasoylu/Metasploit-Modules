#Metasploit-Modules

This module demonstrates a basic SQL injection vulnerability exploit on a target web application. It is intended for beginner-level users to understand the principles of SQL injection attacks. The module sends a crafted SQL query via the User-Agent HTTP header and checks if the target is vulnerable by analyzing the server response. If the target is found to be vulnerable, the module confirms the exploit and reports the vulnerability.
